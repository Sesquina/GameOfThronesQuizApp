This is my Quiz App based on the HBO TV Series Game of Thrones
I used javascript/jQuery/CSS/html

 User story:

This quiz app allows users to take a quiz on a topic about Game of Thrones.
The app starts with an introduction page and by clicking the start button, the user is redirected to the first set of multiple choice questions on the quiz.

If the user gets the selected answer correct, an image will appear with the text: Correct! And a button that directs the user to the next question.

If the user does not get the selected answer correct, the correct answer appears, and a button directs the user to the next question.
Through each question, the user knows which question they are on and what their score is.

Finally, once they are done all 10 questions, a button appears asking them to play again, and it redirects the user to the start of the quiz.
